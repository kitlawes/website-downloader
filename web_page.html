<div id="content" role="main"><h6 class="puzTitle">Lying about their age Puzzle</h6><div class="puzPuzzle"><h6>The Puzzle:</h6><div class="puzText"><div class="puzThumb"><a href="logic-puzzles-index.html"></a></div>Alex, Brook, Cody, Dusty, and Erin recently found out that all of their birthdays were on the same day, though they are different ages. <br />
<br />
On their mutual birthday, they were jabbering away, flapping their gums about their recent discovery. And, lucky me, I was there. Some of the things that I overheard were...<br />
<br />
&bull; Dusty said to Brook: &quot;I&#039;m nine years older than Erin.&quot;<br />
&bull; Erin said to Brook: &quot;I&#039;m seven years older than Alex.&quot;<br />
&bull; Alex said to Brook: &quot;Your age is exactly 70% greater than mine.&quot;<br />
&bull; Brook said to Cody: &quot;Erin is younger than you.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Dusty: &quot;The difference between our ages is six years.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Alex: &quot;I&#039;m ten years older than you.&quot;<br />
&bull; Cody said to Alex: &quot;Brook is younger than Dusty.&quot;<br />
&bull; Brook said to Cody: &quot;The difference between your age and Dusty&#039;s is the same as the difference between Dusty&#039;s and Erin&#039;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I knew these people -- and how old they were, I knew that they were not telling the whole truth. <br />
<br />
After thinking about it, I realized that when one of them spoke to someone older, everything they said was true, but when speaking to someone younger, everything they said was false.<br />
<br />
How old is each person?</div></div><div class="puzFtr">Do you have the answer? Check against <a href="lying-about-their-age-solution.html">our solution</a>!</div><div class="related"><a href="logic-puzzles-index.html">Logic Puzzles</a><a href="index.html">Puzzles Index</a></div></div>
